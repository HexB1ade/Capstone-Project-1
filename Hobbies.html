        <h3><li>Skydiving</li></h3>        
        <p> In order to keep Bob's life exciting, he went on many skydiving trips, as they gave him lots of thrill and attention.</p>
        
        <h3><li>Gambling</li></h3>        
        <p> Bob claims that gambling made him smarter, as he thoroughly enjoyed "strategic play" and "getting high" on gambling nights. He lossed in total of $1,000,000 on gambling in the past years.</p>
    
        <h3><li>Bullying</li></h3>        
        <p> As a wealthy person, he didn't have to follow anybody, so he exerted his power usually during school hours, terrorizing teachers, students, PTA, and eventually his own co-workers.</p>
